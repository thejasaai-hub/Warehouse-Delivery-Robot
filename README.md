# Warehouse-Delivery-Robot

This project is a warehouse delivery robot designed to automate the process of transporting objects from point A to point B. The robot follows a predefined line path, allowing it to autonomously move between two locations. Once it reaches Point A, the robot picks up an object and follows the line to Point B to deliver it. After completing the task, the robot automatically returns to Point A, ready to pick up the next item, and continues this cycle.

This project was developed as part of the Flipkart Grid 3.0 competition, where our team successfully made it to the third round out of four. The primary goal of the competition was to create innovative automation solutions for real-world applications, and our warehouse delivery robot was built to streamline logistics processes within a warehouse setting.

By utilizing line-following technology, the robot can operate autonomously, reducing the need for manual intervention and increasing efficiency. The robotâ€™s ability to repeat its tasks continuously makes it ideal for warehouse environments, where goods need to be transported from one location to another frequently.

A video showcasing the robot in action is available in the project folder.
